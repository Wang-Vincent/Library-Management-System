# Library Management System

# Author: Vincent Wang

# Completion Date: November 2020

This is a python course assignment project, a text-based library management system that allowed users to search books by keywords or move books.

Restrictions were set to ensure books can only be moved between valid locations. 

Users could save their changes by reading/writing the modified records on a txt file.
Unit tests and doctests were performed to ensure functionality without errors.
